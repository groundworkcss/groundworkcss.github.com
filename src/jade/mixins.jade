          |  Sass Mixins
        p
          | Mixins can contain full CSS rules that can be shared throughout your Sass code. They can even take arguments which allows you to produce a wide variety of styles with very few mixins. GroundworkCSS contains mixins that help out with media queries, drop shadows, css3 transitions, inline images (dataURIs), gradients, font stacks and more.
        h6 Example Mixin:
        script(src='https://gist.github.com/ghepting/5282525.js')
        noscript
          p.error.callout Javascript is required to display Gist from Github
        hr
        h6 Example Usage:
        script(src='https://gist.github.com/ghepting/5282572.js')
        noscript
          p.error.callout Javascript is required to display Gist from Github
        h6 Result:
        script(src='https://gist.github.com/ghepting/5282657.js')
